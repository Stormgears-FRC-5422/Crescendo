Note that the Constants.java file is generated during the build process by the code in src/generate. It won't make sense to merge this file, and any edits will be overwritten. So you can pretty much just ignore it as long as you do a build after 
pulling.

For now we've chosen to check this file in to GitHub, but that may change if managing it becomes annoying.
